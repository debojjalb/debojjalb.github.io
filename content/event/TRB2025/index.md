summary: Presented our work on A queuing-theory-based operating capacity model for multimodal port operations in AW010 Ports & Channel Committee lecturn session.
abstract: 'This paper investigates how “operating capacity’” can be meaningfully defined in multimodal maritime freight systems. Shipping channels and ports are complex systems that interact deeply, and the capacities of individual components may differ from the overall capacity of these systems. Accurately determining the operating capacity of a port aids stakeholders in making informed decisions about large-scale infrastructure investments and resource allocation. We present a novel queuing theory- based operating capacity model for computing capacities for waterway, import, and export processes. Our proposed model estimates the operating capacity of a port system by accounting for the interactions between waterways, terminals, and landside infrastructure without the need for a simulation. However, when used with a simulation, our model can compare capacities across different scenarios, thereby helping compare investment alternatives. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method using data for the Port of Houston. The results from our study suggest that the proposed model is a viable method for estimating port operating capacity.'
