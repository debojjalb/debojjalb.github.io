abstract: This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient and safe routing of last-mile electric freight vehicles. With the rising environmental footprint of the transportation sector and the growing popularity of E-Commerce, freight companies are likely to benefit from optimal time-window-feasible tours that minimize energy usage while reducing traffic conflicts at intersections and thereby improving safety. We formulate this problem as a Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows (BSTSPTW) with energy consumed and the number of left turns at intersections as the two objectives while also considering regenerative braking capabilities. We first discuss an exact mixed-integer programming model with scalarization to enumerate points on the efficiency frontier for small instances. For larger networks, we develop an efficient local search-based heuristic, which uses several operators to intensify and diversify the search process. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods using benchmark data and real-world instances from Amazon delivery routes in Austin, US. Comparisons with state-of-the-art solvers shows that our heuristics can generate near-optimal solutions within reasonable time budgets, effectively balancing energy efficiency and safety under practical delivery constraints.
