      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My work centers on three interconnected domains: **trucking infrastructure**, **portâ€“hinterland systems**, and **traffic assignment modeling**. Within these areas, I use operations research techniques and data-driven methods to study and improve multimodal freight and logistics networks.
        
        I am particularly interested in how ports connect to their hinterlands and how bottlenecks in one component ripple across the system. My focus includes capacity measurement, anchorage and terminal queues, resilience during disruptions, re-routing, and the interaction of waterside, terminal, and landside operations. I am also drawn to questions of data quality and integration, as well as economic and policy aspects such as port pricing, demurrage, environmental costs, and the safety and sustainability of large-scale multimodal freight systems.

        **Primary Focus:** Maritime Logistics, Trucking Logistics, Traffic Assignment, Port Operations, Multimodal Freight Networks
        
        **Allied Focus:** Operations Research, Queueing Theory, Discrete Event Simulation, Stochastic User Equilibrium, Network Optimization, Data-Driven Methods

        Beyond publications, I am a strong advocate of open source research and strive to release large-scale frameworks along with documentation for community use.

        **Sep, 2025:** I will presenting our work on "A framework for measuring maritime port system capacities with limited input data" at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2025 in Atlanta (2:45-4:00 PM, TSL invited session on Network Design).

        **Sep 2025:** I have been appointed as Member of the TRB Standing Committee on Intermodal Freight and Truck Transportation for the 2025â€“2028 term. I aim to contrinute to the committee on multimodal port operations, capacity, and resilience.
