      title: 'My Research'
      text: |-
        My work centers on three interconnected domains: **trucking infrastructure**, **portâ€“hinterland systems**, and **traffic assignment modeling**. Within these areas, I use operations research techniques and data-driven methods to study and improve multimodal freight and logistics networks.
        
        I am particularly interested in how ports connect to their hinterlands and how bottlenecks in one component ripple across the system. My focus includes capacity measurement, anchorage and terminal queues, resilience during disruptions, re-routing, and the interaction of waterside, terminal, and landside operations. I am also drawn to questions of data quality and integration, as well as economic and policy aspects such as port pricing, demurrage, environmental costs, and the safety and sustainability of large-scale multimodal freight systems.

        **Primary Focus:** Maritime Logistics, Trucking Logistics, Traffic Assignment, Port Operations, Multimodal Freight Networks
        
        **Allied Focus:** Operations Research, Queueing Theory, Discrete Event Simulation, Stochastic User Equilibrium, Network Optimization, Data-Driven Methods

        Beyond publications, I am a strong advocate of open source research and strive to release large-scale frameworks along with documentation for community use.

        [**For more details and pictures, see my travel page â†’**](https://debojjalb.github.io/travel/)

        **Sep, 2025:** I will presenting our work on "A framework for measuring maritime port system capacities with limited input data" at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2025 in Atlanta (2:45-4:00 PM, TSL invited session on Network Design).

        **Sep 2025:** I have been appointed as Member of the TRB Standing Committee on Intermodal Freight and Truck Transportation for the 2025â€“2028 term. I aim to contrinute to the committee on multimodal port operations, capacity, and resilience.

        **July 2025:** I presented master's thesis on Error Bounds for Stochastic User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment at TRISTAN XII in Okinawa, Japan, focusing on early termination criteria for stochastic traffic assignment problems. [More details here.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/debojjal-bagchi_presented-my-masters-thesis-link-in-comments-activity-7351498036625219584-FcWJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB-24_ABlBO97b8VIUpjxdDlIw_oB4ljeX8)
        
        **Apr 2025:** Our paper on localised queue spillback was accepted at [DTA 2025](https://www.motusanimi.it/dta-abstracts/) in Salerno, Italy on localized queue spillback with uncertain demand.
        
        **Apr 2025:** Our manuscript on bi-criterion Steiner TSP for last-mile electric vehicle logistics is under review in Computers & Operations Research. [A preprint is available here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14848)
