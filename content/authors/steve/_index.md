<!-- ## About Me

Hi! I’m currently a graduate student specializing in Transportation Engineering at the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on traffic assignment, multimodal logistics, and transportation network modeling. I’m particularly interested in applying optimization, simulation, and queueing theory to improve the resilience and efficiency of freight systems and urban mobility. -->
