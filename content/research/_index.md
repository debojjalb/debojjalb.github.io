My work centers on three interconnected domains: **trucking infrastructure**, **portâ€“hinterland systems**, and **traffic assignment modeling**. Within these areas, I use operations research techniques and data-driven methods to study and improve multimodal freight and logistics networks. The selected publications below highlight projects that best reflect my research interests and the balance I aim to strike between methodological contributions and real-world empirical applications.  

Beyond publications, I am a strong advocate of **open source research** and strive to release large-scale frameworks along with documentation for community use. Scroll down to get a list of those. This page also includes my **conference presentations** and **journal publications**, which I update regularly with links to supplementary material and code for replicating results (though they may not always be fully up to date). For an up-to-date list, you can [download my resume](https://debojjalb.github.io/uploads/resume.pdf).
