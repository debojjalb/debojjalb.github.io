truck,A Bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with Time Windows for Last-Mile Electric Vehicle Logistics,"Agarwal, P*.; Bagchi, D*.; Rambha, T.; Pandey, V. (*Equal contribution)",2025,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14848,https://github.com/transnetlab/last-mile-ev-logistics,"We study energy-efficient and safe routing for last-mile delivery using electric freight vehicles. We account for regenerative braking and explicitly model left turns at intersections, which is tricky since each turn depends on three connected nodes. We frame the problem as a bi-criterion Steiner Traveling Salesperson Problem with time windows, develop exact mixed-integer programming models and local-search heuristics, and validate our methods on benchmark instances and Amazon delivery data from Austin.","TRB 102nd Annual Meeting (2023, Washington, D.C., USA, Poster session);  INFORMS Annual Meeting (2022, Indianapolis, USA, Contributed session)",Computers & Operations Research (under review)
port,A Dynamic Ultimate Capacity Framework for Seaport Systems,"Bagchi, D.; Bathgate, K.; Boyles, S. D.",2025,,https://spartalab.github.io/port-simulation/,"Traditional methods to compute capacity rely on simulations, running many scenarios, and then using engineering judgment to define capacity. We define ultimate capacity using a dynamic differential-equation model that can work alongside simulation. We introduce the idea of degree of congestion and make a clear distinction: ultimate capacity is the short-term surge a port can handle under congestion, but it cannot be sustained. Operating capacity is the stable level a port can maintain over time. We further show how our analysis can be used to identify critical bottlenecks in an interconnected port system.",,Working paper
ta,Error Bounds for Stochastic User Equilibrium Traffic Assignment,"Bagchi, D.; Boyles, S. D.",2025,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=vzSxiw4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=vzSxiw4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,https://github.com/debojjalb/SUE_Bounds,"Most traffic assignment algorithms stop using rule-of-thumb measures like relative gap, but these do not guarantee how close the solution is to equilibrium. We derive upper bounds for stochastic user equilibrium that show how far any feasible solution can be from equilibrium in terms of flows and costs. These bounds give a rigorous way to assess convergence and can serve directly as stopping rules in traffic assignment. We show that the bounds are tight, converge linearly near equilibrium, and drastically can cut runtimes in network design applications.","TRISTAN XII (2025, Japan); INFORMS Annual Meeting (2024, Seattle, USA, TSL invited session)",Working paper
ta,Localized Queue Spillback with Uncertain Demand,"Robbennolt, J.; Bagchi, D.; Boyles, S. D.",2025,,,"Dynamic traffic assignment models that include spillback are realistic but depend heavily on accurate demand forecasts, while those without spillback are robust but overlook critical congestion. We develop a localized spillback method that applies spillback only on links with a high likelihood of congestion, identified from demand scenarios. On the Austin network, this approach produces more reliable results than either full spillback or no spillback, while keeping the computational cost reasonable.","DTA Symposium (2025, Salerno, Italy)",Working paper
port,A Queueing-Theory-Based Operating Capacity Model for Multimodal Port Operations,"Bagchi, D.; Bathgate, K.; Boyles, S. D.",2025,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22961,,"We address the challenge that most capacity studies rely on heavy, data-hungry simulations. We develop a queueing-based framework that works with limited data while still capturing the essential dynamics of port operations. This lets us estimate the operating capacity at a long term sustainable level of throughput a port can handle without instability. Applying our framework to the Port of Houston, we find that the system is already operating close to capacity, showing how even small demand surges can quickly trigger delays.","TRB 104th Annual Meeting (2025, Washington, D.C., USA, Lectern session)",Working paper
