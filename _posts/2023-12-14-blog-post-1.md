  <h1>Grad School Application Guide - SOP, LORs, Resume, Shortlist</h1>
  <p>This is essentially an application material preparation guide. I would soon write a post on what you should do develop you profile, but that's the story for another day! For now, you're all set to apply and smash that "apply now" button on your application portal. But wait, you haven't gone past your first SOP draft yet! Well done! You're in the perfect time to read this article. I will not go over the generic stuffs, we all know that! But, I will rather focus on some of the "secret sauce" that might help you stand out and scream "I'm the one!" Well, putting the drama aside lets jump right in.</p>
  
  <p>I will divide this article in 4-parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to choose the grad schools you apply to</li>
    <li>Why your recommendation letters could be a game changer</li>
    <li>How to draft your perfect SOP and diversity statements</li>
    <li>How to write a killer resume</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>And yes, I highly encourage reading them in order.</p>

### 1/4: How to choose the right grad schools to apply?

<div class="section application-section">
  <p>Here is a step by step guide:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fine tune your research interest. Academics love niche. Your niche should ideally be at an intersection of what you had done in your undergrad and what you would like to do in your graduate studies. It's awesome if you already have some research background in your niche. If not, having any research experience helps, more on that later.</li>
    <li>Find advisors who works in your niche. This is the most time consuming part of your application. You will scrape the internet during this period! Ideally you should keep 2â€“3 months for this. Look into various universities, their department websites, head over to the "people" section. Skim through researches done by various professors and see who are working in the same niche as you would like to work. Update everything in an excel sheet. You should track the universities, potential advisors (PI) and how much match you think there is between their work and your niche.</li>
    <li>Here's a quick trick: Search on google the following phrase to find advisors who are currently recruiting "recruiting PhD students [topic] twitter X" and so some web scraping.</li>
    <li>Talk with your recommenders. Ask them which universities they have contacts in. I used to take an excel sheet with a fairly long list of university and potential advisors that I wanted to apply and ask my recommenders which places should I finally apply / which groups are doing great in the field / which advisors they have personal contacts with, and so on.</li>
    <li>Please do not just apply to advisors who are from your country. (ofcourse, this applies only if youre an international student!) Many students think there is a higher chance of getting selected if you apply to someone from your country. NO! In most cases they are already getting hundreds of mails and applications from students from your country and diversity is highly encouraged in most labs / groups in US.</li>
    <li>Mail. Mail. Mail. Your excel sheet is about to become colorful! Start mailing your potential advisors along with your time in step 2. Color code your excel sheet rows with whether you mailed your PI, whether they replied positively, negatively or did not reply. It's okay even if they do not reply. And most of them wouldn't. They are probably receiving hundreds of such mails. However, they will get a call-back to your email when they see your application. Many professors contacted me after I applied on the same thread that I had mailed them earlier. If they do reply and encourage you to apply, don't forget to remind them once you apply. A simple "I am looking forward to you reading my application" should be good. Your mail should have a structure like:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Talk who you are, your educational background and that you're applying to grad program and state your intent of the mail that you're mailing to ask if they would be recuitiung PhD students this admission cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Your Background:</strong> Briefly talk about your research background, your publications, projects, and conferences. Dont overload. One or two should be fine.</li>
    <li><strong>Why them?:</strong> Explain how their research matches with your niche. State the papers of them that are in similar domains to your current work. Explain how they would ideal for your academic aspiarations.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclude:</strong> Conclude saying you would love to discuss further with them over video conferencing if they could give some time to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Attach your resume and transcripts and hit that send button! Oh, dont forget to proofread!</p>

### 2/4: How your recommendation letters could be a game changer!

<div class="section application-section">
  <p>Well done! You have chosen your graduate schools. The next step is to request your current advisors, professors and instructors for a reference letters. A reference letter can make or break your application. A recommendation from someone very well known in the field with good connections is very helpful in your application. Try to have a balance between people who know you very well and people who are very well known in the field.</p>

### 3/4: How to draft the perfect Statement of Purpose and Diversity Statement?

<div class="section application-section">
  <p>A single piece of paper can't decide your future. Wrong! SOP is that single piece of paper that represents you to the committee.</p>
