    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm currently a graduate student specializing in 
        <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/research/research-areas/transportation-engineering">Transportation Engineering</a>
        at the <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/">Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic journey began with a 
        <a href="https://ug.iisc.ac.in/">BS (research)</a> degree from the 
        <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore</a>, 
        where I majored in Earth & Environmental Science along with a minor in Mathematics. 
        During my time there, I was associated with the 
        <a href="http://civil.iisc.ernet.in/%7Etarunr/group.html">Transportation Networks Lab</a> at the 
        <a href="https://cistup.iisc.ac.in/">Center for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation & Urban Planning (CiSTUP)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past two years, I have delved into sustainable logistics and transportation. 
        My roots trace back to the picturesque city of Kalyani, nestled near Kolkata. 
        I then moved to Bangalore, often referred to as the Garden City of India, for my undergraduate studies. 
        Currently, I call the vibrant and musically-rich city of Austin my home.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My primary area of interest lies in transportation network analysis, traffic assignment, and optimizing routes with a focus on environmental impacts. I have worked extensively on reverse logistics network design, variants of the Travelling Salesman Problem, and traffic routing. Recently, I developed a keen interest in congestion pricing and tolling. In my research, I consistently employ metaheuristics and mathematical programming as my go-to solution techniques.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Focus:</strong> Transportation Network Optimization, Sustainable Transportation, Congestion Pricing, Traffic Equilibrium</p>
        <p><strong>Allied Focus:</strong> Convex Optimization, Discrete Event Simulation, Metaheuristics, Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Mathematical Programming</p>
